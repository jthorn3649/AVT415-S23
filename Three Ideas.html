	<dd>My first idea is to create a conceptual furniture website. The websites intention is to allow user to interact with and collect furniture from a broad selection of designers and companies. The goal of this site is to create an effective navigational system which corresponds accurately through each page and footer/header navigation. Establishing a function checkout process for products is also a main focus for this website.</dd>
